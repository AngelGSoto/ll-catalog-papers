\section{Newest bow shock description}
\label{sec:description}

\subsection{Southeast group}
\label{sec:se-group}

\textit{169-338.} This is a small and faint previously reported proplyd \citep{ODell:1994a, Ricci:2008a} with a well defined tail. The emission arc associated to this proplyd is very faint and clumpy but well-defined. 

\textit{189-329.} The central source was first classified as star by \citet{ODell:1996a} and later as a proplyd by \citet{Ricci:2008a}. This object is a very faint proplyd associated with a very diffuse shell. The northern bow wing is much more extended than the southern wing. The fact that the shell is so large and diffuse, may be an indication that it is not related to the proplyd, although the fact that a small cavity is seen  around the proplyd suggests that some degree of physical interaction is indeed occurring.

\subsection{North group}
\label{sec:n-group}

\textit{142-301.} The central source was first catalogued as cusp with tail \citep{ODell:1996a} and later as proplyd \citep{Bally:2000a, Ricci:2008a}. This large proplyd has one of the longest tails (\(4''\)) of any proplyd and does not have a hemispherical head. Instead, the ionization front appears to trace the disk surface, which is inclined with respect to the tail by about $55^{\circ}$. The proplyd tail points away from \(\mathrm{\theta^1\,Ori~A}\) instead of \thC~and exhibits some bends and wiggles \citep{Bally:2000a}. This proplyd is surrounded by a very faint emission arc.  Rather than showing continuous curvature, the emission arc appears to comprise two straight edges, which meet at a point south-east of the proplyd, with the shell being thicker on the southern side.

\textit{154-225.} The central source was previously catalogued as elongated body with diffuse boundary \citep{ODell:1996a}. Later, \citet{Ricci:2008a} reported it as proplyd in a binary sytem (the main body). The central source is sorrounded by a very faint and lumpy emission arc.

\textit{154-240.} The central source is a large bright proplyd \cite{Bally:2000a, Ricci:2008a} with a \(3''\) long tail and the inclined protoplanetary disk is seen in silhouette \citep{Bally:2000a}. There is evidence of an emission arc associated with this proplyd, but only the inner edge can be clearly traced. The outer edge of the shell merges with a thick knotty structure whose origin is unclear.

\textit{159-221.} This central source was first classified as a star by \citet{ODell:1996a}. This same source was reported as a dark disk seen only in silhouette by \citet{Ricci:2008a}. But a faint emission rim can be seen surrounding the disk in the \ha{} image, suggesting that it is an externally ionized proplyd. We identified an emission arc associated with the central star. The outer edge of the shell is very diffuse, which  makes it difficult to trace of outer rim. The axis of the bowshock is significantly deviates from the radial direction.

\textit{163-222.} The central proplyd was first catalogued by \citet{ODell:1996a}. There is a compact \(0.''15\) diameter disk seen nearly in face-on embedded in this stubby proplyd \citep{Bally:2000a, Ricci:2008a}.  This source was also reported as a binary sytem \citep{Ricci:2008a}. An a very faint and small emission arc wraps the proplyd. The outer and inner edges of the shell are well-defined on the eastern side, nevertheless the western side is superimposed on an unrelated a brighter larger scale emission filament, making impossible to trace the arc boundaries on this side.

\textit{170-249.} This central source is a previously catalogued proplyd \citep{ODell:1996a}, reported as a binary system by \citet{Ricci:2008a}. This bright and large proplyd exhibits a long tail and an inclined disk seen in silhouette \citep{Bally:2000a}. Several filamentary emission features with arc shape crosses the object, nonetheless it is possible to identify a very faint emission arc that seems to be associated to the proplyd.

\textit{173-236.} The central source is a large bright proplyd catalogued by \citet{ODell:1996a}, \citet{Bally:2000a} (designated as 174-236) and \citet{Ricci:2008a}. The proplyd with an irregular and wavy tail \citep[see][]{Bally:2000a} is surrounded by a very faint spiky emission arc. 

\textit{178-258.}  This large and weak proplyd was catalogued by \citet{Ricci:2008a}, which is surrounded by a well-defined but faint emission arc.

\subsection{Northwest group}
\label{sec:nw-group}

\textit{4578-251.} This is a very bright T Tauri star associated with an emission arc that presents a double-shell morphology. This object has an asymmetric bow shock and the shell is more extended toward the south than to the north. The emission of the outer shell is fainter than the inner shell and is unclear whether the region marked with points is part of the outer shell.

\textit{049-143.} Figure shows a proplyd \citep{Ricci:2008a} with a very diffuse arc of emission. Its shell is thick, the wings of the bow shock are very open, and circular shaped. The inner edge is more diffuse than the outer edge and the bow shock is asymmetric. The  proplyd has a short tail, probably indicating that it is highly inclined and there is extinction in the center. 
 
\textit{051-024.} We identified a previously uncataloged proplyd with its bow shock located in front of the upper end of the North Bright
Bar. The emission shell is thin, but a second larger, and more diffuse, emission shell is seen in front of the bow shock that we have
marked. It is unclear whether this outer shell is related to the object or not. If it is, then the object would be similar to the nearby 072-134. 

\textit{072-134.} This object is located to the south east from 051-134. It was first cataloged by \citet{ODell:1996a} designated as 072-135. Later, \citet{Ricci:2008a} listed a disk seen nearly edge-on, also named 072-135. In this work a shell with a complex morphology is identify. The inner edge is a narrow bright arc, while the shell is thick and faint, which is only visible on the N~side.        

\textit{074-229.} This central source is located at south east of 073-227. It is a T Tauri star, that appears to be the smaller twin of the nearby 073-227, associated with a small and faint emission bow shock. The central star is not obviously a proplyd, but this may be because it is too small to be resolved. The projected separation from 072-134 is about \(8''.0\), which is not significantly smaller than the expected mean projected separation between nearest neighbors given the stellar density at this distance from the Trapezium \citep{Reipurth:2007a}, 
% http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....134.2272R
so the evidence that they form a physical binary pair is weak.

\textit{101-233.} The central source was first cataloged as proplyd by \citet{ODell:1996a}, designated as 102-233, and later by \citet{Ricci:2008a} with the same name. This proplyd is associated with a clumpy, thin and low ionization bow shock. Several additional broad filamentary emission features can be seen in front of the arc, but it is unclear if these are associated with the object or are a chance superposition, that also seem to be aimed toward Trapezium. 

\textit{102-157.} We identified a previously uncataloged proplyd associated with a very faint emission arc. The proplyd tail is very short, indicating that it is highly inclined. 102-157 has a open bow. The southwest wing of the bowshock is crossed by an apparently unrelated east-west oriented filament, which makes it difficult to trace the emission arc on this side.

------

\textit{106-245 and 109-246.} The bright proplyd 109-246
\citep{Ricci:2008a} was previously cataloged as 109-247 by
\citet{Bally:2000a}, who noted its central dark disk and possible
microjet.  The proplyd is situated just outside the HH~202 bow shock
and is superimposed on a complex background of fainter HH bow shocks
that point towards the north west.  However, a
south-east facing bow shock is also clearly visible just in front of
the proplyd.  We identify this as a stationary arc due to its
symmetric placement with respect to the proplyd axis and clear
morphological differences from the HH bow shocks.

A similar, albeit much smaller arc can be seen in front of the stellar
source 106-245.  Given the complex nebular background, the evidence
for an arc is not overwhelming, but is strengthened by the
morphological similarity with the nearby 109-246.  As with 074-249, the
source is not obviously a proplyd, but again this may be simply due to
its small size.  


\textit{124-131.} This object is a circumbinary proplyd, that was
first cataloged by \citet{ODell:1996a}, but they named it 124-132 and
classified as irregular. Later, this source was reported by
\citet{Smith:2005a} showing a microjet emerging perpendicular to the
major axis of the disk. \citet{Ricci:2008a} cataloged the source as a
binary system and \citet{Robberto:2008a} interpreted the central dark
silhouette as a circumbinary disk.  We report the discovery of a
broad, faint partial shell in front of the proplyd, which we identify
as a stationary arc.  The arc is barely visible in \ha{}, but is much
clearer in green and blue wideband filters, suggesting that we are
seeing dust-scattered continuum.  In this respect it is similar to the
arc in front of the close-in proplyd 163-317 (LV~3).   
 
\textit{206-043.} This object appears to show an extremely faint
emission arc.  However, it is seen against a strongly variable nebula
background and a filamentary foreground extinction feature is seen
nearby (\(\approx 3''\) to west).  It is therefore possible that
the apparent arc is merely an ilusion caused by an extension of these
extinction filaments.  Although it is not cataloged as a proplyd, the
central source shows indications of a faint conical tail, pointing
almost due North, with a length \(\approx 2''\). 

\subsection{Southwest group}
\label{sec:sw-group}

\textit{4582-635.} This is a previously cataloged proplyd
\citep{Ricci:2008a}, which is surrounded by a very faint emission arc
that has not been reported previously in the literature. There are
hints of additional emission knots in front of the arc, but the S/N is
very low and it is unclear if they are related with the object.

\textit{4596-400.} \citet{Bally:2000a} first reported this object as a
``wind collision front'' with the designation 000-400. The central
source was identified as a proplyd by \citet{Ricci:2008a}, who gave it
the designation 4596-400 based on more accurate astrometry, which we
adopt here. The outer edge of the wings of the emission arc can be
traced to much farther distances than is typical, at least 5 times the
axial radius of curvature. The northern wing appears knotty at large
distances, whereas the southern wing is smooth. However, the knots
seen superimposed on the northern wing may be due to an unrelated,
larger scale filament that crosses both this object and 012-407, which
is most prominent in blue/green continuum filters.

\textit{042-628.} This source appears in the proplyd catalog of
\citet{Ricci:2008a} with the designation 038-627, supposedly based on
appearance in previous catalogs \citep{ODell:1996a}. However, we haver
been unable to locate the source in any other catalogs and the source
coordinates clearly indicate a designation of 042-628, which we adopt
here.  A bright compact knot is seen just inside the emission arc,
\(\approx 2''\) to the north of the proplyd, which may represent a
jet.  A fainter knot is also seen closer to the proplyd, but at a
slightly larger position angle.


\textit{065-502.} This was classified as a  non-proplyd stellar source by \citet{ODell:1996a}. This star has a small protrusion which points away from Trapezium, probably indicating a proplyd tail. This proplyd tail is very short, suggesting that the object it is highly inclined. This object is located \(\approx 22.0''\) to the northeast of LL 1.  

*The source is surrounded by a very faint emission arc, which has not been previously reported in the literature.  

el arco trazado a mi no me parece rodear al proplyd, y no estoy segura de que esté relacionado con éste. 

\textit{083-435.} This central source shows a very faint tail suggesting that this source is a proplyd not previously catalogued. This central source is surrounded by a width and diffuse emission arc.

\textit{117-421.} This was first classified as a non-proplyd stellar source by \citet{ODell:1996a}, nevertheless later, was catalogued as proplyd by \citet{Ricci:2008a} based on the long tail that it shows. We identified a small and very faint emission arc wrapping the central source in which the evidence of the outer edge is not visible. 

\textit{121-434.} This is  a previously catalogued proplyd \citep{Ricci:2008a}, which is surrounded by a compact emission arc that was not previously catalogued. This arc is in a highly variable background that make it look clumpy.

*Es de doble cáscara?

\subsection{West group}
\label{sec:w-group}

\textit{4285-458.} This is an emission arc that wraps a bright star. Although the outer boundary of the shell is well-defined, it is impossible to trace the shell's inner boundary due to confusion with the PSF wings of the central star. This is the most distant emission arc from the Trapezium in this catalog and It is also much smaller than the other arcs in the west group.  

\subsection{South group}
\label{sec:s-group}

\textit{066-3251.} This object was classified as a proplyd by \citet{Ricci:2008a} and, located at a distance \(\sim 10'\) south of the ONC core, it is one of the farthest known proplyds from the Trapezium. We have identified a faint arc associated with this proplyd, which is seen most clearly in the F555W broad band filter but is also visible in the \ha{} filter. This object is projected onto the tip of a large-scale wishing bone shaped filament, which seems to represent a local ionization front. We believe that the ``outflow'', which \citet{Ricci:2008a} identify to the south of this object is merely a misidentification of part of this filament.  

\textit{116-3101.} Figure shows a proplyd associated with a small but sharply defined emission arc.  The central star is also named V488 Ori \citep{Bally:2006a}. The wings of the bow shock are very closed, the outer edge is well defined and has a circular shape since we can fit a perfect circle with the points marked.  

\textit{119-3155.} This is a binary system  associated with an emission arc. Based on the position of the outer of curvature of the arc, we assign the fainter, more northern binary component as the corresponding stellar source. It has a faint arc to the north and another to the east (Fig), but  the east arc is probably unrelated to the object, and may instead be associated with the HH 880 bowshock which passes \(15''\) to the south. This emission arc has not been previously reported in the literature.     

\textit{136-3057.} This is a T Tauri star associated with an emission arc. It is located to the north of 119-3155 and is one of the bigger objects of this group. 136-3057 has a very diffuse shell. This has not been previously reported in the literature.

\textit{138-3024.} Figure shows a T Tauri star associated with a thin shell. The arc is seen most strongly blue and green broad band filters, but it is also seen at very low contrast in the \ha{} filter. This object has not been previously reported in the literature.

\textit{203-3039.} This object has a microjet (HH 561) which was discovered in the Fabry-Pérot study of the southern Orion Nebula by \citet{Bally:2001a}. Later, this HH object was described in more detail by \citet{Bally:2006a}, the microjet emerges toward the east from the variable star MY Ori, terminating in a faint bowshock at a distance of \(16''\). A fainter counterjet and bowshock are located west of the star. In addition to these previously reported features, we identify an LL-type emission arc associated with MY Ori. The faint bow is very open.

\textit{261-3018.} This is a relatively large and diffuse LL-type arc previously unreported, seen superimposed on a very complicated region of overlapping flows. We tentatively identify the star 261-3018 as the source, although the star (264-3016) is another possible candidate. In the \ha{} the 261-3018 star (which is the same source as 262-3018 reported by \citealp{Bally:2006a})  shows a linear protrusion of length \(\simeq1''\) towards the southwest. This is unlikely to be a proplyd tail, since it is not aligned with the radial direction from the Trapezium, and instead may be a microjet. Indeed, a series of faint knots and bowshocks extend for \(30''\) in the same direction. The LL-type arc is very flat and shows a bright rim at its inner edge. It extends further to the east than to the west. The object is seen in projection superimposed on the HH 502 flow but shows no evidence of physical interaction with this flow. 

\textit{362-3137.} This is a previously uncatalogued proplyd associated with an emission arc. However, \citet{Da-Rio:2009a} catalogued the central source as a star. The source is a double star. It is located at north of LL 7. This object seems to show a double-shell morphology. There is a filament to south probably unrelated to the object. This emission arc has not been previously reported in the literature.
