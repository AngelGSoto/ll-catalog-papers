* Reports of Skype meetings
** [2016-09-28 Wed 10:30]
+ We revised the descriptions of the SW group
  + Complete as far as 042-628
+ The NW group still needs to be checked over
** [2016-10-05 Wed 10:54]
+ Complete as far as end of SW group
+ Severeal objects have been moved to the "ambiguous" category
** [2016-10-14 Fri 12:10]
+ 142-301 (N group), 051-024 (NW group) and 101-233 (NW group) : three cases that seems to have external "arc" with shape similar to the one that was traced (internal)
  It has to be mentioned. Where?
+ We revised all the groups looking for objects with ambiguous determination
  + 173-236 (N group) - is moved to ambiguous (A) group, it is not clear if the structure is an arc or a hole
  + 106-245 (NW group) - stays at NW group
  + w014-414 (SW group) - stays at SW group, the tracing of the arc has to be reviewed
  + 041-637 (SW group) - stays at SW. It is not a filamente due its shape is different from what is in its environment, this can be taken as evidence that the structure is related to the star.
    The structure at the right has to be mentioned in the description.
  + 066-652 (S group) - it is not clear, is moved to A group
  + 131-046 (ambiguous group) - stays at A group, the "arc" could be just a continuos area that is being crossed by an extintion filament
+ All the other cases that already were moved to the A group stays there.
** [2016-10-26 Wed]
+ Finished moving objects to the problematic group
+ Really finish SW group

** [2016-11-09 Wed]
+ Finished Far West group
+ Started on North group, but not much progress
+ Discovered some new objects in the south east
** [2016-11-17 Thu 09:10]-[2016-11-17 Thu 11:30]
+ Discovered 6 new arcs, in between SW and Far-W groups
  + Might be best to merge these two groups
+ Looked for new arcs in the outer Bally ACS fields
  + Started in the south, working north

+ We should maybe discuss these
  + 142-301 (N group),
  + 051-024 (NW group)
  + and 101-233 (NW group) 
+ Three cases that seems to have external "arc" with shape similar to the one that was traced (internal)


* TODO Make a separate .bib file with the references that we need

* Additional notes on particular objects
** 308-3036
Superimposed on unrelated jet-driven bowshock from LL6

* New arc discoveries
1. [X] 4417-653
   + [2016-11-16 Wed] Discovered this while looking at jet knots for the Alba project
   + Located 20 arcsec to SE of LL3
   + Very strange that I never saw it before
2. [X] 4491-627
   + 5:34:49.074 -5:26:26.65
   + Looks legit
     + But there is another bowshock nearby, that looks like a HH object, so must be careful
3. [X] 4550-659
   + Coordinates 5:34:55.026 -5:26:58.88
   + This is a definite detection
   + Has jet knots too
     + Possibly two jets. Spike to NW and smaller one to SE.  Knots to E.
     + Also, possible bowshock overlying end of S wing of arc
4. [X] 4531-628
   + 5:34:53.072 -5:26:27.51
   + Pretty definite that the arc is real
   + Arc is very small (R0  ~= 0.64 arcsec)
5. [X] 4520-419
   + 5:34:52.005 -5:24:18.86
   + Beautiful arc (R0 ~= 1.2 arcsec)
     + Wide radius of curvature
   + Looks like it might be a proplyd
     + Small stubby tail
6. [X] 4505-336
   + 5:34:50.484 -5:23:35.52
   + N arm of the arc is missing
   + Very faint curved jet seems to go N of star
     + May curve through 90 degrees and end in a bow shock
